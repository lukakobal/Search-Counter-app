# React Render & Derived Data 🧠

Simple app demonstrating how React re-renders components and recalculates derived data.

## Concepts
- useState triggers re-render
- whole component function runs again
- filteredUsers is derived data (not state)
- no useEffect needed

## Why this matters
This pattern is used everywhere in real React apps and is core junior knowledge.
